//  Purpose:
//  This project will demonstrate the basics of creating a PONG application for ios devices. The reader will learn
//  how to create game objects in Xcode and to assign logic to those game objects. This basic PONG application will
//  walk through creating two paddles, a ball, and a label. At the end of this project the reader will see a simple
//  PONG application where the two paddles track the ball and hit the ball continuously.
